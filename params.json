{"name":"Discourse-import-bbpress","tagline":"bbPress importer for Discourse","body":"# What is this\r\n\r\nThis set of rake tasks imports users, threads, and posts from a bbPress\r\ninstance into Discourse.\r\n\r\n* Post dates and authors are preserved\r\n* User accounts are created from bbPress, but have no login\r\n  capabilities. The emails addresses are set, and gravatars work, but\r\nusers will need to log in to activate their accounts.\r\n* There is a `test` mode to test the connection to the mysql server and\r\n  read posts\r\n\r\n**Use at your own risk!** Seriously, test this on a dummy Discourse\r\ninstallation first.\r\n\r\n# Instructions\r\n\r\n* **Important:** *disable* your email configuration or ou will spam all\r\n  your users with hundreds of emails. To do this, add this to your\r\nenvironemnt config (e.g. `config/environments/development.rb`):\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nconfig.action_mailer.delivery_method = :test\r\nconfig.action_mailer.smtp_settings = { address: \"localhost\", port: 1025 }\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstall and start `mailcatcher` to monitor the sending of notification\r\nemails:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ gem install mailcatcher\r\n$ mailcatcher --http-ip 0.0.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Be sure to have at least one user in your Discourse instance. If not,\r\n  create one and set the username in `config/import_bbpress.yml`.\r\n\r\n* Edit `config/import_bbpress.yml` with your database connection\r\n  information and `discourse_admin` username.\r\n\r\n* Install the `mysql2` gem:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ bundle install\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** You may need to install the header files for mysql. For OS X,\r\nyou can do this with `brew install mysql`; for Debian, `sudo apt-get\r\ninstall libmysqlclient-dev`; on CentOS/RHEL, `sudo yum install\r\nmysql-devel`.\r\n\r\n* Copy `config/import_bbpress.yml` to your `discourse/config` directory\r\n* Copy `lib/tasks/import_bbpress.rake` to your `discourse/lib/tasks/`\r\n  directory\r\n* In your discourse instance, run `rake import:bbpress`\r\n\r\n**Note:** if you are running multisite, you will need pass your database\r\ninstance: `export RAILS_DB=<your_database> rake import:bbpress`\r\n\r\n* Cross your fingers\r\n* If everything worked, deploy\r\n* Be sure to have your users reset their passwords on the new Discourse\r\n  site.\r\n\r\n# Contributing\r\n\r\nPlease make all pull requests to the develop branch.
